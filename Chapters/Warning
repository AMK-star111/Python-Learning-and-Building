All the notes here are made with help of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Chat GPT model by Open AI.

Because it's made with help of AI, I would like to suggest not to fully trust this, it's correct data but might contain small error so please double check by your side too.

Otherwise all the notes are good to go and are trustable, but its my duty to tell and I have done it.

These notes can be highly benifitial to refresh the concepts. Don't expect it to be like full guides. 

Thanks!
